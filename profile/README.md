# Welcome to jQAssistant-Plugin ðŸ‘‹

jQAssistant is an Open-Source-Tool that helps you to analyze and control the quality of your software systems. 
Its plugin-based architecture allows the user to adapt jQAssistant to the needs of the analyzed project by adding
* scanner plugins to support additional file formats
* rule plugins to support frameworks, technologies, and libraries as well as common architectural and design patterns
* report plugins to support the reporting of results in new formats

## About the organization

This GitHub organization provides a collection of useful extensions to jQAssistant (see [repositories](https://github.com/orgs/jqassistant-plugin/repositories)).

The core jQAssistant distribution is developed in our [main organization](https://github.com/jqassistant).
Please have a look there for general information and when having issues or feature requests.

Examples and tutorials can be found in our [examples organization](https://github.com/jqassistant-tutorials).
We recommend that every (new) user takes a look at it and be inspired.

## Way of contribution

We're happy about every contribution. To make this as efficient as possible, take a look at the following guidance:

* Issues should have a meaningful description, best with an example for reproduction. If possible to identify, put the issue into the repository of the part (e.g. core, a plugin, an example) where the issue occurred. This saves us a lot of time.
  * We're happy to accept pull requests that solve the issue. 
* Feature Requests should have a meaningful description, best with an example. If possible to identify, put the feature request into the repository of the part (e.g. core, a plugin, an example) where you expect the feature to be. This saves us a lot of time.
    * We're happy to accept pull requests that implement the request.
